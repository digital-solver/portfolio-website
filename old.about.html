      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
      <p>
        ðŸ¤– Hey, I'm <strong>Kerr</strong>, the
        <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/digital-solver"
          >@digital-solver</a
        >. At heart I'm a 'Solver': an entrepreneurial technologist, inventor,
        futurist, artificer, and innovator. I am driven by a passion for
        technology and business and a desire to explore the limitless potential
        of advanced technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        ðŸš€ With a strong background in tech startups and a deep fascination with
        the intersection of technology and business, I am constantly seeking out
        innovative ways to
        <em>drive growth and value</em>. My research into the potential for AI
        to be musically creative sparked a deeper interest in the
        <strong>business applications of advanced technologies</strong>. I have
        since dedicated myself to seeking out or building innovative and
        advanced solutions that address real-world problems and produce
        widespread value.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ðŸŒ± As a <strong>full-stack</strong> JavaScript developer with experience
        in the <strong>MERN</strong> and <strong>MEAN</strong> stacks, I am
        always looking for new ways to push the boundaries of software
        development and leverage emerging technologies. I am also committed to
        staying at or beyond the cutting edge, and am actively studying
        <strong>Python for AI</strong> and
        <strong>Rust for performance</strong> to further enhance my skills.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        ðŸŽ¸ When not dreaming up new tech businesses, you'll find me exploring
        the interaction of music and technology, whether through improvising a
        solo on my guitar, composing new pieces, or writing algorithms to
        generate original compositions. Music is a <em>true passion</em> for me,
        and I enjoy finding ways to incorporate it into my other interests.
      </p>
      <p>
