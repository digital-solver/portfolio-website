            Scynapse is a web application that allows science-fiction
            enthusiasts to access information about different sci-fi movies,
            directors, and genres, update their personal information and create
            a list of their favourite movies.

          <h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
          <p>
            The purpose of the project was to create a web application that
            provides movie information to users and allows them to create a list
            of their favourite movies. I was given a project brief, and some
            user stories and technical requirements to complete this project.

          <h3>Objective</h3>
          <p>
            My objective during the project was to meet the needs and
            expectations of the target users according to the given user
            stories, providing users with information about movies, directors
            and genres, and allowing users to update their personal information
            and create a list of their favourite movies.

          <h3>Tools, Skills, & Methodologies</h3>
          <p>
            I used React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to build the
            application. I also used Agile, specifically a Kanban board, to
            track progress and prioritise tasks. I created a second interface
            using Angular.
            <br /><br />
            I used Git for version control and JWT-based authentication and
            authorisation, and Bootstrap was used for the design of the app.
            <br /><br />
            I learned the importance of using functional components instead of
            class components, and the power of using version control systems to
            keep track of code changes.

          <h3>Designing Scynapse</h3>
          <p>
            The design and planning phase of the project was focused on
            understanding the needs and expectations of the target users.
            <br /><br />
            To do this, I created user flows for the user stories that described
            the various features and functionality of the app.
            <br /><br />
            I also designed an interface in Figma, taking into account UX and UI
            principles to help make the app accessible and usable.
            <br /><br />
            These materials helped me to stay focused on the goal of the project
            and ensure that the app met the needs of the users.

            To keep track of my progress and prioritise tasks, I used a Kanban

            project.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            For the front-end of the app, I was responsible for building the
            client-side using React. My tasks included implementing various
            interface views, handling data through the REST API endpoints, and
            ensuring a polished, accessible, and responsive user experience on
            any device.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study__text-container">
          <h3>Decisions Made</h3>
          <p>
            One important decision I made was to use Redux for state management,
            as I believed it would provide the most efficient and scalable
            solution for Scynapse. <br /><br />
            This decision ended up being quite challenging, as I had to spend a
            significant amount of time learning and implementing Redux. However,
            the benefits of using Redux made it worth the effort, as it allowed
            me to manage the app's global state in a predictable and
            maintainable way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study__text-container">
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            If I could do anything differently in the future, it would be to
            consider using a different design solution rather than relying on a
            library like Bootstrap. <br /><br />
            While it was convenient to use at first, I found myself spending a
            lot of time trying to customise it to fit the exact look and feel I
            was going for.
            <br /><br />
            In the future, I think I would either try using something like
            styled-components or even just building the styles from scratch
            conventionally to have more control and flexibility in the design
            process.

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>
            One lesson I learned during this project was the importance of using
            functional components instead of class components whenever possible.
            <br /><br />
            Initially, I was using class components for the majority of my UI
            because I was more familiar with them. However, as I continued to
            work on the project, I realised that functional components had
            several benefits, including improved readability and simplicity, and
            performance due to fewer overheads. I decided to refactor my code to
            use functional components wherever possible, and I believe it
            improved the efficiency and maintainability of my app while making
            it more future proof as functional components are the direction that
            React is going in.
            <br /><br />
            In the future, I will make a conscious effort to use functional
            components as much as possible in my projects.

          <h3>Summary</h3>
          <p>
            For the back-end of the app, I was responsible for building the
            server-side component using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
            <br /><br />
            My tasks included designing, implementing, and testing a REST API,
            connecting the API to a MongoDB database, and implementing user
            authentication and authorisation.

        </div>
        <div class="case-study__text-container">
          <h3>Decisions Made</h3>
          <p>
            In terms of decision-making, I chose to use Node.js, Express, and
            MongoDB for the server-side of the application because they are
            well-suited for building REST APIs and interacting with NoSQL
            databases. <br /><br />
            I also chose to use JWT-based authentication and authorisation
            because it is a simple and secure way to manage user sessions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="case-study__text-container">
          <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>
            In retrospect, I might have considered using a different database or
            storage solution, such as an SQL database.
            <br /><br />While MongoDB worked well for this small-scale project,
            an SQL database could have offered some advantages in terms of more
            structured data modelling, improving data integrity, and taking
            advantage of indexing which, if the database ever scaled in the
            future and became as big as IMDB, it would have significantly sped
            up the querying process. <br /><br />
            If I’d considered potential future scaling issues, I might have
            explored this option more thoroughly before deciding on a database
            solution.

          <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
          <p>
            One lesson I learned during this project is the power of using
            version control systems to keep track of code changes.
            <br /><br />
            With Git, I was able to easily track all the updates I made to the
            code, making it easy to make changes and be confident that I wasn’t
            permanently messing up my work, if I ever needed to go back in time
            to an older version of the code, Git had my back.
            <br /><br />
            This project taught me that Git is a total game-changer and a tool
            I'll definitely be taking with me to future projects.

            Building Scynapse was a challenging but rewarding experience. The
            app was a great example of how to use React and Node.js to build a
            responsive and scalable web application.
            <br /><br />
            Through this project, I learned the importance of user-centred
            design, efficient state management, and proper testing and
            deployment.
            <br /><br />
            I also learned valuable lessons about using version control systems,
            code reusability and scalability.
            <br /><br />
            Overall, the end product was a well-designed and functional app that
            serves the needs of sci-fi movie enthusiasts well.
