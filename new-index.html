            Hi, I'm Kerr - inventor, problem-solver and creative at heart,
            dynamic, solutions-oriented innovator at work.<br /><br />I bring a
            unique blend of experience, having worked as a Chief Customer
            Officer for a SaaS analytics start-up before transitioning to
            JavaScript development using the MERN stack.<br /><br />It was my
            passion for technology and love for solving problems that drove me
            to explore the new challenges, build new solutions, and stay ahead
            of the curve.

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>
            My background in commercial strategy, business development, product
            marketing, and agile methodologies gives me a strong foundation in
            developing and executing effective SaaS strategies, as well as
            promoting customer insights and leading teams.<br /><br />I am also
            results-driven and detail-oriented while always keeping the big
            picture in mind. This combination makes me a great fit for a
            JavaScript development role in a diverse and agile team.

          <h3>Specialty & Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Tech startups are my forte, but I won't shy away from the challenge
            of heleping bring big non-tech companies into the 21st century.
            <br /><br />
            My goal is to create user-centred tech products that drive growth
            for business and entrepreneurship and I'm on the lookout for a
            company with a culture that values freedom, respect, learning,
            adaptability, and creativity.

          <h3>Personality üï¥üèΩ</h3>
          <p>
            I‚Äôm your typical casual eccentric with a dry sense of humour that
            likes to immerse myself in music and can often be found playing
            guitar, composing new pieces, or experimenting with algorithmic
            compositions. Music is a deep passion and I always look for ways to
            incorporate it into my other interests. <br /><br />
            I‚Äôve also been known to enjoy getting lost in a good long Brandon
            Sanderson tome and taking time for a healthy dose of deep
            introspection.
